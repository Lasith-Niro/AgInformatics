## Apply What You Have Learned

Surely you did not take this class just to have fun.  As graduate students you likely have projects you need to complete, data you need to analyze, ideas you want to make happen.  Now is your chance.  For your final project you can do whatever you want with Python.  At the end you will need to demonstrate it to the class. Show off, expound on some topic only you care about, do something unique.  Here are some ideas for your final project:

1.  Do something with your data you are working on for your MS or PhD.  Could be data analysis with Python using Scikit-learn or some or other program.  

2.  Deomonstrate some unique module you are interested in.  

3.  Find a new module for making awesome figures and make some awesome figures.

4.  Find an API you are interested in and demonstrate it for everyone.  

5.  Do something else that you are interested in that you could teach to the rest of the class.

### To Get Your Final Grade

1.  You will do a 6-8 minute presentation on your project to the class.

2.  Make a GitHub repository for the project and push your code, the markdown write up of the project, and your PowerPoint or figures you created to the repository.
